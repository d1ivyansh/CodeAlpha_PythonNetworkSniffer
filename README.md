Creating a network sniffer involves working with low-level network packets, so we'll use the scapy library in Python. Scapy is a powerful packet manipulation tool and packet sniffer. Here's a basic example of how you can create a simple network sniffer in Python using scapy:


First, make sure you have scapy installed. You can install it using pip:   
pip install scapy


To Run Script use:   
python3 tool.py

#Make sure you run this script with root/administrative privileges to capture packets on your network interface.
